# Email Verification System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the email verification system with OTP (One-Time Password) that has been implemented in the AI Interviewer platform.

## Architecture

User Registration â†’ Generate OTP â†’ Send Email â†’ User Enters OTP â†’ Verify OTP â†’ Email Verified â†’ Resume Upload
```

## Components Implemented

### 1. Email Configuration (`src/lib/email.js`)
A reusable email utility using nodemailer with the following functions:

- **`sendEmail()`**: Core function to send any email
  - Parameters: `to`, `subject`, `html`, `text`
  - Uses SMTP configuration from environment variables
  - Returns: `{ success: boolean, messageId/error: string }`

- **`sendOTPEmail(email, name, otp)`**: Sends beautiful OTP verification email
  - Professional HTML template with gradient design
  - Shows 6-digit OTP code prominently
  - Includes expiry time and security warnings
  - Fallback plain text version

- **`sendWelcomeEmail(email, name)`**: Sends welcome email after verification
  - Congratulates user on successful verification
  - Lists next steps (upload resume, review data, start interviews)
  - Includes link to dashboard

- **`verifyEmailConfig()`**: Tests SMTP connection
  - Validates email server is ready
  - Useful for startup health checks

### 2. User Model Updates (`src/models/User.js`)
Added OTP-related methods to User schema:

- **`generateOTP()`**: Creates and stores OTP
  - Generates random 6-digit number
  - Hashes OTP using SHA256 before storing (security best practice)
  - Sets expiry time based on `OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES` env variable
  - Returns plain OTP for email sending
  
- **`verifyOTP(otp)`**: Validates provided OTP
  - Checks if OTP exists and not expired
  - Hashes provided OTP and compares with stored hash
  - Returns boolean result
  
- **`clearOTP()`**: Removes OTP data after successful verification
  - Clears `emailVerificationToken` and `emailVerificationExpires`

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Registration Endpoint (`/api/auth/register`)
**Changes made:**
- Creates user with `emailVerified: false`
- Generates OTP using `user.generateOTP()`
- Sends OTP email via `sendOTPEmail()`
- Returns success WITHOUT JWT token (forces verification)
- Response includes `requiresVerification: true` flag

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful! Please check your email for the verification code.",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "emailVerified": false
  },
  "requiresVerification": true
}
```

#### OTP Verification Endpoint (`/api/auth/verify-otp`)
**Route:** `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "otp": "123456"
}
```

**Process:**
1. Validates OTP format (must be 6 digits)
2. Finds user by email
3. Checks if already verified
4. Verifies OTP using `user.verifyOTP(otp)`
5. Marks user as `emailVerified: true`
6. Clears OTP data
7. Sends welcome email (async, doesn't block response)
8. Generates JWT token
9. Sets HTTP-only cookie
10. Returns user data

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email verified successfully! Welcome to AI Interviewer.",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "role": "user",
    "emailVerified": true
  }
}
```

#### Resend OTP Endpoint (`/api/auth/resend-otp`)
**Route:** `POST /api/auth/resend-otp`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Process:**
1. Finds user by email
2. Checks if already verified
3. **Rate limiting**: Prevents resending if current OTP still valid for >8 minutes
4. Generates new OTP
5. Sends new email
6. Returns success

**Rate Limiting Logic:**
```javascript
// If OTP expires in 10 minutes, allow resend only after 2 minutes
// This prevents abuse while allowing legitimate resends
if (minutesLeft > (totalMinutes - 2)) {
  return 429; // Too Many Requests
}
```

### 4. Email Verification Page (`/auth/verify-email`)

**Features:**
- **6-digit OTP input** with auto-focus and auto-submit
- **Paste support**: Can paste full 6-digit code
- **Countdown timer**: 60-second cooldown for resend
- **Auto-submit**: Automatically submits when all 6 digits entered
- **Keyboard navigation**: Backspace moves to previous input
- **Loading states**: Shows spinner during verification/resend
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages
- **Email display**: Shows email address being verified
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop

**URL Format:**
```
/auth/verify-email?email=user@example.com
```

**UI Components:**
- Email icon header with gradient background
- 6 input boxes for OTP digits (styled as large boxes)
- Verify button (disabled until all 6 digits entered)
- Resend button with countdown timer
- Help text with tips (check spam, expiry time)
- Back to registration link

### 5. Updated Registration Page
- Changed redirect from `/dashboard` to `/auth/verify-email?email=...`
- Updated success message to indicate email verification step

## Environment Variables

### Required Configuration (`.env.local`)
```bash
# Email Configuration (SMTP)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=AI Interviewer <noreply@aiinterviewer.com>

# OTP Configuration
OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES=10
NEXT_PUBLIC_OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES=10  # For frontend display
```

### Gmail Setup (for developers)
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication in Google Account
2. Generate App Password: [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Use App Password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD` (not your regular password)

## Security Features

### 1. OTP Hashing
- OTPs are **never stored in plain text**
- Uses SHA256 hashing before database storage
- Even if database compromised, OTPs can't be read

### 2. Expiry Mechanism
- OTPs expire after configurable time (default: 10 minutes)
- Expired OTPs automatically rejected

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Prevents OTP spam by limiting resend frequency
- 60-second cooldown in UI
- Server-side validation: can't resend if current OTP still fresh

### 4. No Authentication Without Verification
- JWT token only generated AFTER email verification
- Unverified users can't access protected routes

### 5. Input Validation
- OTP must be exactly 6 digits
- Email format validation
- XSS protection (Next.js built-in)

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path
1. User fills registration form
2. Submits â†’ sees success message
3. Redirected to verification page
4. Receives email with OTP within seconds
5. Enters OTP (or pastes from email)
6. Auto-submits when complete
7. Sees "Email verified" message
8. Gets JWT cookie automatically
9. Redirected to resume upload page

### Error Handling
- **Invalid OTP**: Clear error message, inputs reset, focus on first box
- **Expired OTP**: Can click "Resend" to get new code
- **Email not sent**: Registration still succeeds, user can resend
- **Network error**: Friendly error message, can retry

## Next Steps (Resume Upload)

After email verification, users should:
1. Be redirected to `/auth/upload-resume`
2. Upload PDF resume
3. System parses resume
4. Show editable form with parsed data
5. Save to Resume model
6. Redirect to dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env.local`
2. For Gmail, ensure App Password (not regular password)
3. Check firewall/antivirus blocking port 587
4. Test with `verifyEmailConfig()` function

### OTP Not Working
1. Check system time (affects expiry calculation)
2. Verify `OTP_EXPIRY_MINUTES` is set
3. Check database for `emailVerificationToken` field
4. Ensure user document has OTP saved

### "User Not Found" Error
1. Verify email case (stored as lowercase)
2. Check `isActive: true` filter
3. Ensure user was created successfully
